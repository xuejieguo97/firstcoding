# First Coding Assignment

This sample application functions as a to do list and should allow you to read write and delete posts. 
It is still under development since I have added all the functions inside but the UI part is a bit messy so oveall it is still not working, unfortunately.

The app should be able to run on Xcode. Once you git clone this, you should be able to run it successfully on your end. If there is any issue, you can try 'pod install' in the terminal under the directory where you saved all the code.
